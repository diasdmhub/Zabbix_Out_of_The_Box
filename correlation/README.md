# EVENT CORRELATION

Event correlations are very resourceful features of Zabbix because they allow you to correlate problem events to their resolution in a manner that is very precise and flexible.

Zabbix offers two types of correlations. [Trigger-based event correlation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/event_correlation/trigger) is where a trigger can be used to relate separate problems to their solution. [Global event correlation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/event_correlation/global) handles how new problem events are paired with existing problem events and what to do in case of a match.

These are some useful correlation scenarios references.

# ZABBIX OUT OF THE BOX

**Due to the many scenarios that are handled on a daily basis with Zabbix, it is easy to forget or simply misplace an intelligent solution to a monitoring scenario. Therefore, this repository has been created to store standard and different approaches to Zabbix monitoring.**
**It is also of interest to disclose limitations found as well as innovations as they may help future monitoring projects.**

**This could be referenced as a knowledge base (KB) for Zabbix scenarios, issues or general tips.**

# ZABBIX GOOD PRACTICES

Below are some good Zabbix practices that encompass general tips, strategies or techniques to make Zabbix environment more efficient, clear, and organized for day-to-day use. This compilation includes [Zabbix's own "best practices"][best_practices] as well as other good practices.

| ‚úÖ Practice | üìù Remarks|
| :---     | :---   |
| **Make sure [Zabbix definitions][zabbix_def] are well known for operators** | Clear knowledge of essential Zabbix entities like templates, hosts, items, triggers, and events, ensures smooth daily operations and troubleshooting. |
| **Standardize names for hosts, groups, templates, and other entities** | Name standards are very important for an optimal search of hosts, groups and other elements. Filters are often used to search for data in Zabbix, and standard names help users to find the correct entity or value. External systems integrated with Zabbix (_e.g. Grafana_) can also benefit from an intelligent naming scheme. |
| **[Use templates][use_templates] as much as possible and avoid direct host configurations** | Templates make configuration consistent and scalable. |
| **Don't forget to use mass updates when dealing with multiple entities** | Mass updates allow you to efficiently modify many templates, hosts, items, triggers, etc., reducing manual work. |
| **Use [master and dependent items][dependent_items]** | This minimizes requests to monitored entities. |
| **Configure items with [custom intervals][custom_intervals]** | Items can collect data only when it is necessary, which helps save storage space. This can also help to ignore data fluctuations when it is insignificant. |
| **Watch for very low data collection intervals** | Frequent data queries can burden the network environment and the objects being monitored, as well as fill the DB with unnecessary data. |
| **Build triggers with [coherent severities][trigger_severities] (run from `Disaster` for everything)** | Severities can serve as visual cues that indicate the level of priority an event may have, ensuring that events are prioritized and addressed appropriately. |
| **Use dashboards to visualize what really matters** | Effective information sharing relies on good visual data presentation. Focus on key metrics and organize the data considering the target audience for easy interpretation. Avoid overcrowding the dashboard with excessive data. Consider nesting [dashboards into pages][dashboards_pages] or tabs for improved usability. |
| **Create dashboards with the same visual language** | Consistent visual design prevents misinterpretation of data and ensures clarity across your monitoring setup. |
| **Configure dashboards and [widgets refresh interval][refresh_interval] according to the item interval** | If an item is updated only once every 10 minutes, there is no need to update the dashboard every 30 seconds. Align widget refresh rates with item update intervals to avoid redundant loads on your frontend and database. |
| **Configure [trigger dependencies][trigger_depend] to prevent cascading events or actions** | Dependencies reduce alert noise and unecessary actions. |
| **Regularly revise and clean inactive items, triggers, and hosts** | Fix or disable unsupported items, or remove inactive hosts. |
| **Use [Zabbix Proxies][zabbix_proxies] for distributed environments** | |
| **Integrate notification channels and customize messages** | Tailor notification messages for different users and systems to provide clear, actionable alerts. |
| **[Harden Zabbix security][zabbix_access]** | Secure the frontend and database as well. |
| **Train teams and disseminate the monitoring and observability culture** | Encourage all participants to have a clear understanding of the purpose and benefits of monitoring the environment, whether IT or business-related. |
